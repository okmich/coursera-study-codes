    "Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a consulting firm, and you've been tasked with analyzing documents from multiple clients. Each client provides their data in different formats: some in PDFs, others in Word documents, CSV files, or even HTML webpages. Manually loading and parsing each document type is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors. Your goal is to streamline this process, making it efficient and error-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you'll use LangChain’s powerful document loaders. These loaders allow you to read and convert various file formats into a unified document structure that can be easily processed. For example, you'll load client policy documents from text files, financial reports from PDFs, marketing strategies from Word documents, and product reviews from JSON files. By the end of this lab, you will have a robust pipeline that can handle any new file formats clients might send, saving you valuable time and effort.\n"

Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and virtual agents.\\u202f\\n\\n\\nLangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.\\n\\n\\nIntegrations with LLMs\\n\\n\\nLLMs are not standalone applications: they are pre-trained statistical models that must be paired with an application (and, in some cases, specific data sources) in order to meet their purpose.\\nFor example, Chat-GPT is not an LLM: it is a chatbot application that, depending on the version you’ve chosen, uses the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language model. While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and the IBM watsonx portfolio of AI products greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                The latest AI News + Insights \\u2028\\n            \\n\\n                Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\\xa0\\r\\n\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe today\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        How does LangChain work?\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of\\xa0abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps.\\n\\n\\nAbstractions are a common element of everyday life and language. For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\\n\\n\\nImporting language models\\n\\n\\nNearly any LLM can be used in LangChain. Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\\nMany open source models, like BigScience’s BLOOM, Meta AI’s LLaMa and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face (link resides outside ibm.com). IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\\n\\n\\nPrompt templates\\n\\n\\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered.\\u202fYou can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.\\n\\n\\nChains\\n\\n\\nAs its name implies, chains are the core of LangChain’s workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\\nThe most basic chain is LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call chain_example.run(“input”).\\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\\n\\n\\nIndexes\\n\\n\\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\\n\\n\\nDocument loaders\\n\\n\\nLangChain offers\\xa0a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\\n\\n\\nVector databases\\n\\n\\nUnlike “traditional” structured databases,\\xa0vector databases\\xa0represent data points by converting them into\\xa0vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using\\xa0unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\\n\\n\\nText splitters\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTo increase speed and reduce computational demands, it’s often wise to split large text documents into smaller pieces.

Available in both Python- and Javascript-based libraries, LangChain’s tools and APIs simplify the process of building LLM-driven applications like chatbots and virtual agents.\\u202f\\n\\n\\nLangChain serves as a generic interface for nearly any LLM, providing a centralized development environment to build LLM applications and integrate them with external data sources and software workflows. LangChain’s module-based approach allows developers and data scientists to dynamically compare different prompts and even different foundation models with minimal need to rewrite code. This modular environment also allows for programs that use multiple LLMs: for example, an application that uses one LLM to interpret user queries and another LLM to author a response.\\nLaunched by Harrison Chase in October 2022, LangChain enjoyed a meteoric rise to prominence: as of June 2023, it was the single fastest-growing open source project on Github.1 Coinciding with the momentous launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT the following month, LangChain has played a significant role in making generative AI more accessible to enthusiasts in the wake of its widespread popularity.\\nLangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.\\n\\n\\nIntegrations with LLMs\\n\\n\\nLLMs are not standalone applications: they are pre-trained statistical models that must be paired with an application (and, in some cases, specific data sources) in order to meet their purpose.\\nFor example, Chat-GPT is not an LLM: it is a chatbot application that, depending on the version you’ve chosen, uses the GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 language model. While it’s the GPT model that interprets the user’s input and composes a natural language response, it’s the application that (among other things) provides an interface for the user to type and read and a UX design that governs the chatbot experience. Even at the enterprise level, Chat-GPT is not the only application using the GPT model: Microsoft uses GPT-4 to power Bing Chat.\\nFurthermore, though foundation models (like those powering LLMs) are pre-trained on massive datasets, they are not omniscient. If a particular task requires access to specific contextual information, like internal documentation or domain expertise, LLMs must be connected to those external data sources. Even if you simply want your model to reflect real-time awareness of current events, it requires external information: a model’s internal data is only up-to-date through the time period during which it was pre-trained.\\nLikewise, if a given generative AI task requires access to external software workflows—for example, if you wanted your virtual agent to integrate with Slack—then you will need a way to integrate the LLM with the API for that software.\\nWhile these integrations can generally be achieved with fully manual code, orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and the IBM watsonx portfolio of AI products greatly simplify the process. They also make it much easier to experiment with different LLMs to compare results, as different models can be swapped in and out with minimal changes to code.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                The latest AI News + Insights \\u2028\\n            \\n\\n                Discover expertly curated insights and news on AI, cloud and more in the weekly Think Newsletter.\\xa0\\r\\n\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe today\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        How does LangChain work?\\r\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nAt LangChain’s core is a development environment that streamlines the programming of LLM applications through the use of\\xa0abstraction: the simplification of code by representing one or more complex processes as a named component that encapsulates all of its constituent steps.\\n\\n\\nAbstractions are a common element of everyday life and language. For example, “π” allows us to represent the ratio of the length of a circle’s circumference to that of its diameter without having to write out its infinite digits. Similarly, a thermostat allows us to control the temperature in our home without needing to understand the complex circuitry this entails—we only need to know how different thermostat settings translate to different temperatures.\\nLangChain is essentially a library of abstractions for Python and Javascript, representing common steps and concepts necessary to work with language models. These modular components—like functions and object classes—serve as the building blocks of generative AI programs. They can be “chained” together to create applications, minimizing the amount of code and fine understanding required to execute complex NLP tasks. Though LangChain’s abstracted approach may limit the extent to which an expert programmer can finely customize an application, it empowers specialists and newcomers alike to quickly experiment and prototype.\\n\\n\\nImporting language models\\n\\n\\nNearly any LLM can be used in LangChain. Importing language models into LangChain is easy, provided you have an API key. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for all models.\\nMost LLM providers will require you to create an account in order to receive an API key. Some of these APIs—particularly those for proprietary closed-source models, like those offered by OpenAI or Anthropic—may have associated costs.\\nMany open source models, like BigScience’s BLOOM, Meta AI’s LLaMa and Google’s Flan-T5, can be accessed through Hugging Face (link resides outside ibm.com). IBM watsonx, through its partnership with Hugging Face, also offers a curated suite of open source models. Creating an account with either service will allow you to generate an API key for any of the models offered by that provider.\\nLangChain is not limited to out-of-the-box foundation models: the CustomLLM class\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) allows for custom LLM wrappers. Likewise, you can use the IBM watsonx APIs and Python SDK, which includes a LangChain integration, to build applications in LangChain with models that you’ve already trained or fine-tuned for your specific needs using the WatsonxLLM class (and that model’s specific project ID).\\n\\n\\nPrompt templates\\n\\n\\nPrompts are the instructions given to an LLM. The “art” of composing prompts that effectively provide the context necessary for the LLM to interpret input and structure output in the way most useful to you is often called prompt engineering.\\nThe PromptTemplate class in LangChain formalizes the composition of prompts without the need to manually hard code context and queries. Important elements of a prompt are likewise entered as formal classes, like input_variables. A prompt template can thus contain and reproduce context, instructions (like “do not use technical terms”), a set of examples to guide its responses (in what is called “few-shot prompting”), a specified output format or a standardized question to be answered.\\u202fYou can save and name an effectively structured prompt template and easily reuse it as needed.\\nThough these elements can all be manually coded, PromptTemplate modules empower smooth integration with other LangChain features, like the eponymous chains.\\n\\n\\nChains\\n\\n\\nAs its name implies, chains are the core of LangChain’s workflows. They combine LLMs with other components, creating applications by executing a sequence of functions.\\nThe most basic chain is LLMChain. It simply calls a model and prompt template for that model. For example, imagine you saved a prompt as “ExamplePrompt” and wanted to run it against Flan-T5. You can import LLMChain from langchain.chains, then define chain_example = LLMChain(llm = flan-t5, prompt = ExamplePrompt). To run the chain for a given input, you simply call chain_example.run(“input”).\\nTo use the output of one function as the input for the next function, you can use SimpleSequentialChain. Each function could utilize different prompts, different tools, different parameters or even different models, depending on your specific needs.\\n\\n\\nIndexes\\n\\n\\nTo achieve certain tasks, LLMs will need access to specific external data sources not included in its training dataset, such as internal documents, emails or datasets. LangChain collectively refers to such external documentation as “indexes”.\\n\\n\\nDocument loaders\\n\\n\\nLangChain offers\\xa0a wide variety of document loaders for third party applications\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). This allows for easy importation of data from sources like file storage services (like Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive), web content (like YouTube, PubMed or specific URLs), collaboration tools (like Airtable, Trello, Figma and Notion), databases (like Pandas, MongoDB and Microsoft), among many others.\\n\\n\\nVector databases\\n\\n\\nUnlike “traditional” structured databases,\\xa0vector databases\\xa0represent data points by converting them into\\xa0vector embeddings: numerical representations in the form of vectors with a fixed number of dimensions, often clustering related data points using\\xa0unsupervised learning methods. This enables low latency queries, even for massive datasets, which greatly increases efficiency. Vector embeddings also store each vector’s metadata, further enhancing search possibilities.\\nLangChain provides integrations for over 25 different embedding methods, as well as for over 50 different vector stores (both cloud-hosted and local).\\n\\n\\nText splitters\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTo increase speed and reduce computational demands, it’s often wise to split large text documents into smaller pieces. LangChain’s\\xa0TextSplitters\\xa0split text up into small, semantically meaningful chunks that can then be combined using methods and parameters of your choosing.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval\\n\\n\\nOnce external sources of knowledge have been connected, the model must be able to quickly retrieve and integrate relevant information as needed. Like watsonx, LangChain offers\\xa0retrieval augmented generation (RAG):\\xa0its\\xa0retriever\\xa0modules accept a string query as an input and return a list of\\xa0Document’s as output.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\n\\nLLMs, by default, do not have any long-term memory of prior conversations (unless that chat history is used as input for a query). LangChain solves this problem with simple utilities for adding memory to a system, with options ranging from retaining the entirety of all conversations to retaining a summarization of the conversation thus far to retaining the n\\xa0most recent exchanges.\\n\\n\\nAgents\\n\\n\\nLangChain agents can use a given language model as a “reasoning engine” to determine which actions to take. When building a chain for an agent, inputs include:\\na list of available tools to be leveraged.user input (like prompts and queries).any relevant previously executed steps.\\n\\n\\nTools\\n\\n\\nDespite their heralded power and versatility, LLMs have important limitations: namely, a lack of up-to-date information, a lack of domain-specific expertise and a general difficulty with math.\\nLangChain tools\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) are a set of functions that empower LangChain agents to interact with real-world information in order to expand or improve the services it can provide.

For example, an LLM can be trained to generate additional data samples that closely resemble the data points in a training dataset.Virtual agents: Integrated with the right workflows, LangChain’s Agent modules can use an LLM to autonomously determine next steps and take action using robotic process automation (RPA).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Ebook\\n        \\n\\n            How to choose the right foundation model\\n        \\nLearn how to choose the right approach in preparing datasets and employing foundation models.\\n\\nRead the ebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n            \\n\\n     \\n    Related solutions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Foundation models\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nExplore Granite 3.2 and the IBM library of foundation models in the watsonx portfolio to scale generative AI for your business with confidence.\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore watsonx.ai\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Artificial intelligence solutions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nPut AI to work in your business with IBM’s industry-leading AI expertise and portfolio of solutions at your side.\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore AI solutions\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    AI consulting and services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nReinvent critical workflows and operations by adding AI to maximize experiences, real-time decision-making and business value.\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore AI services\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            AI models\\n        \\n\\n            Explore IBM Granite\\n        \\nDiscover IBM® Granite™, our family of open, performant and trusted AI models, tailored for business and optimized to scale your AI applications.

Created by IBM and Red Hat, the InstructLab community project provides a cost-effective solution for improving the alignment of LLMs and opens the doors for those with minimal machine learning experience to contribute.Join the InstructLab community \\nWhat does InstructLab do?LLMs serve as the foundation for generative AI use cases, like chatbots and coding assistants. These LLMs can be proprietary (such as OpenAI’s GPT models and Anthropic’s Claude models) or offer varying degrees of openness around pretraining data and usage restrictions (such as Meta’s Llama models, Mistral AI’s Mistral models, and IBM’s Granite models).AI practitioners often need to adapt a pretrained LLM to suit a particular business purpose. But there are limits to the ways you can modify an LLM:Fine-tuning an LLM to understand a specific area of knowledge or skills typically involves forking an existing open model, then running expensive, resource-intensive training.There’s no way to incorporate improvements back to the upstream project, and thus no way for models to continuously improve from community contributions.LLM refinements have typically required large amounts of human-generated data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to get.InstructLab follows an approach that punches through those limitations. It can enhance an LLM using far less human-generated information and far fewer computing resources than are typically used to retrain a model. And it makes it possible for upstream contributions to continuously make the model better.InstructLab is named after and based on IBM Research’s work on Large-scale Alignment for chatBots, abbreviated as LAB. The LAB method is described in a\\xa02024 research paper by members of the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and IBM Research.InstructLab is not model-specific. It can provide supplemental skills and knowledge fine-tuning to an LLM of your choice. This “tree of skills and knowledge” improves continuously from community contributions and can be applied to support regular builds of an enhanced LLM. InstructLab maintains an\\xa0enhanced version of IBM Granite. Two other lab-enhanced models released by IBM include\\xa0Labradorite, which is derived from Llama 2, and\\xa0Merlinite, which is derived from Mistral. The InstructLab project prioritizes fast iteration and intends to retrain models on a regular basis. Organizations can also use the InstructLab model alignment tools to train their own private LLMs with their own proprietary skills and knowledge. \\n\\nRed Hat resourcesKeep reading\\n\\n\\nHow does InstructLab work?The LAB method consists of 3 components:Taxonomy-driven data curation. Taxonomy is a set of diverse training data curated by humans as examples of new knowledge and skills for the model.Large-scale synthetic data generation. The model is then used to generate new examples based on the seed training data. Recognizing that synthetic data can vary in quality, the LAB method adds an automated step to refine the example answers, making sure they’re grounded and safe.Iterative, large-scale alignment tuning. Finally, the model is retrained based on the set of synthetic data. The LAB method includes 2 tuning phases: knowledge tuning, followed by skill tuning.The contributions of data from the community can lead to regular iterative builds of enhanced LLMs, each made better by the tree of skills generated from community contributions. \\nHow is InstructLab different from other methods of training an LLM?Let’s compare InstructLab to the other steps in creating and improving an LLM.PretrainingDuring pretraining, an LLM is trained to predict the next token using trillions of tokens of unlabeled data. This gets really expensive, sometimes requiring thousands of GPUs and months of time. Pretraining a highly capable LLM is only possible for organizations with significant resources.Alignment tuningAfter pretraining, LLMs undergo alignment tuning to make the model’s answers as accurate and useful as possible. The 1st step in alignment tuning is typically instruction tuning, in which a model is trained directly on specific tasks of interest. Next is preference tuning, which can include reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In this step, humans test the model and rate its output, noting if the model’s answers are preferred or unpreferred. An RLHF process may include multiple rounds of feedback and refinement to optimize a model.Researchers have found that the amount of feedback at this alignment tuning stage can be much smaller than the initial set of training data―tens of thousands of human annotations, compared to the trillions of tokens of data required for pretraining―and still unlock latent capabilities of the model.InstructLabThe LAB method emerged from the idea that it should be possible to realize the benefits of model alignment from an even smaller set of human-generated data. An AI model can use a handful of human examples to generate a large amount of synthetic data―then refine that list for quality―and use that high-quality synthetic data set for further tuning and training. In contrast to instruction tuning, which typically need thousands of examples of human feedback, LAB can make a model significantly better using relatively few examples provided by humans.How is InstructLab different from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?The short answer is InstructLab and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solve different problems.RAG is a cost-efficient method for supplementing an LLM with domain-specific knowledge that wasn’t part of its pretraining. RAG makes it possible for a chatbot to accurately answer questions related to a specific field or business without retraining the model. Knowledge documents are stored in a vector database, then retrieved in chunks and sent to the model as part of user queries. This is helpful for anyone who wants to add proprietary data to an LLM without giving up control of their information, or who needs an LLM to access timely information.\\xa0This is in contrast to the InstructLab method, which sources end-user contributions to support regular builds of an enhanced version of an LLM. InstructLab helps add knowledge and unlock new skills of an LLM.It’s possible to \"supercharge\" a RAG process by using the RAG technique on an InstructLab-tuned model.Learn more about RAG\\xa0 \\nWhat are the components of the InstructLab project?InstructLab is composed of several projects.TaxonomyInstructLab is driven by taxonomies, which are largely created manually and with care. InstructLab contains a taxonomy tree that lets users create models tuned with human-provided data, which is then enhanced with synthetic data generation.Command-line interface (CLI)The InstructLab CLI lets contributors test their contributions using their laptop or workstation. Community members can use the InstructLab technique to generate a low-fidelity approximation of synthetic data generation and model-instruction tuning without access to specialized hardware.Model training infrastructureFinally, there’s the process of creating the enhanced LLMs. It takes GPU-intensive infrastructure to regularly retrain models based on new contributions from the community. IBM donates and maintains the infrastructure necessary to frequently retrain the InstructLab project’s enhanced models.Dig deeper into AI infrastructure \\nDiscover Red Hat Enterprise Linux AIWhen you’re ready to bring AI to the enterprise, Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® AI brings together the Granite family of open source-licensed LLMs, InstructLab model alignment tools, a bootable image of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, enterprise-grade technical support, and model intellectual property indemnification.Red Hat Enterprise Linux is the world’s leading enterprise Linux platform, certified on hundreds of clouds and with thousands of hardware and software vendors.

       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'file-sample.docx'}, page_content='Demonstration of DOCX support in calibre\\n\\nThis document demonstrates the ability of the calibre DOCX Input plugin to convert the various typographic features in a Microsoft Word (2007 and newer) document. Convert this document to a modern ebook format, such as AZW3 for Kindles or EPUB for other ebook readers, to see it in action.\\n\\nThere is support for images, tables, lists, footnotes, endnotes, links, dropcaps and various types of text and paragraph level formatting.\\n\\nTo see the DOCX conversion in action, simply add this file to calibre using the “Add Books” button and then click “Convert”.  Set the output format in the top right corner of the conversion dialog to EPUB or AZW3 and click “OK”.\\n\\n\\n\\nText Formatting\\n\\nInline formatting\\n\\nHere, we demonstrate various types of inline text formatting and the use of embedded fonts.\\n\\nHere is some bold, italic, bold-italic, underlined and struck out  text. Then, we have a superscript and a subscript. Now we see some red, green and blue text. Some text with a yellow highlight. Some text in a box. Some text in inverse video.\\n\\nA paragraph with styled text: subtle emphasis  followed by strong text and intense emphasis. This paragraph uses document wide styles for styling rather than inline text properties as demonstrated in the previous paragraph — calibre can handle both with equal ease.\\n\\nFun with fonts\\n\\nThis document has embedded the Ubuntu font family. The body text is in the Ubuntu typeface, here is some text in the Ubuntu Mono typeface, notice how every letter has the same width, even i and m. Every embedded font will automatically be embedded in the output ebook during conversion. \\n\\nParagraph level formatting\\n\\nYou can do crazy things with paragraphs, if the urge strikes you. For instance this paragraph is right aligned and has a right border. It has also been given a light gray background.\\n\\nFor the lovers of poetry amongst you, paragraphs with hanging indents, like this often come in handy. You can use hanging indents to ensure that a line of poetry retains its individual identity as a line even when the screen is  too narrow to display it as a single line. Not only does this paragraph have a hanging indent, it is also has an extra top margin, setting it apart from the preceding paragraph.\\n\\nTables\\n\\nITEM\\n\\nNEEDED\\n\\nBooks\\n\\n1\\n\\nPens\\n\\n3\\n\\nPencils\\n\\n2\\n\\nHighlighter\\n\\n2 colors\\n\\nScissors\\n\\n1 pair\\n\\nTables in Word can vary from the extremely simple to the extremely complex. calibre tries to do its best when converting tables. While you may run into trouble with the occasional table, the vast majority of common cases should be converted very well, as demonstrated in this section. Note that for optimum results, when creating tables in Word, you should set their widths using percentages, rather than absolute units.  To the left of this paragraph is a floating two column table with a nice green border and header row.\\n\\nNow let’s look at a fancier table—one with alternating row colors and partial borders. This table is stretched out to take 100% of the available width.\\n\\nCity or Town\\n\\nPoint A\\n\\nPoint B\\n\\nPoint C\\n\\nPoint D\\n\\nPoint E\\n\\nPoint A\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint B\\n\\n87\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint C\\n\\n64\\n\\n56\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint D\\n\\n37\\n\\n32\\n\\n91\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nPoint E\\n\\n93\\n\\n35\\n\\n54\\n\\n43\\n\\n—\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, we see a table with special formatting in various locations. Notice how the formatting for the header row and sub header rows is preserved.\\n\\nCollege\\n\\nNew students\\n\\nGraduating students\\n\\nChange\\n\\n\\n\\nUndergraduate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCedar University\\n\\n110\\n\\n103\\n\\n+7\\n\\nOak Institute\\n\\n202\\n\\n210\\n\\n-8\\n\\n\\n\\nGraduate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCedar University\\n\\n24\\n\\n20\\n\\n+4\\n\\nElm College\\n\\n43\\n\\n53\\n\\n-10\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n998\\n\\n908\\n\\n90\\n\\nSource: Fictitious data, for illustration purposes only\\n\\nNext, we have something a little more complex, a nested table, i.e. a table inside another table. Additionally, the inner table has some of its cells merged. The table is displayed horizontally centered.\\n\\nOne\\n\\nThree\\n\\nTwo\\n\\n\\n\\nFour\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the left is a table inside a table, with some cells merged.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe end with a fancy calendar, note how much of the original formatting is preserved. Note that this table will only display correctly on relatively wide screens. In general, very wide tables or tables whose cells have fixed width requirements don’t fare well in ebooks.\\n\\nDecember 2007\\n\\nSun\\n\\n\\n\\nMon\\n\\n\\n\\nTue\\n\\n\\n\\nWed\\n\\n\\n\\nThu\\n\\n\\n\\nFri\\n\\n\\n\\nSat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStructural Elements\\n\\nMiscellaneous structural elements you can add to your document, like footnotes, endnotes, dropcaps and the like. \\n\\nFootnotes & Endnotes\\n\\nFootnotes and endnotes are automatically recognized and both are converted to endnotes, with backlinks for maximum ease of use in ebook devices.\\n\\nDropcaps\\n\\nD\\n\\nrop caps are used to emphasize the leading paragraph at the start of a section. In Word it is possible to specify how many lines of text a drop-cap should use. Because of limitations in ebook technology, this is not possible when converting.  Instead, the converted drop cap will use font size and line height to simulate the effect as well as possible. While not as good as the original, the result is usually tolerable. This paragraph has a “D” dropcap set to occupy three lines of text with a font size of 58.5 pts. Depending on the screen width and capabilities of the device you view the book on, this dropcap can look anything from perfect to ugly.\\n\\nLinks\\n\\nTwo kinds of links are possible, those that refer to an external website and those that refer to locations inside the document itself. Both are supported by calibre. For example, here is a link pointing to the calibre download page. Then we have a link that points back to the section on paragraph level formatting in this document.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThere are two approaches that calibre takes when generating a Table of Contents. The first is if the Word document has a Table of Contents itself. Provided that the Table of Contents uses hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it. The levels of the Table of Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word.\\n\\nIf no Table of Contents is found in the document, then a table of contents is automatically generated from the headings in the document. A heading is identified as something that has the Heading 1 or Heading 2, etc. style applied to it. These headings are turned into a Table of Contents with Heading 1 being the topmost level, Heading 2 the second level and so on.\\n\\n You can see the Table of Contents created by calibre by clicking the Table of Contents button in whatever viewer you are using to view the converted ebook. \\n\\n\\tDemonstration of DOCX support in calibre\\t1\\n\\n\\tText Formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tInline formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tFun with fonts\\t2\\n\\n\\tParagraph level formatting\\t2\\n\\n\\tTables\\t3\\n\\n\\tStructural Elements\\t5\\n\\n\\tFootnotes & Endnotes\\t5\\n\\n\\tDropcaps\\t5\\n\\n\\tLinks\\t5\\n\\n\\tTable of Contents\\t5\\n\\n\\tImages\\t7\\n\\n\\tLists\\t8\\n\\n\\tBulleted List\\t8\\n\\n\\tNumbered List\\t8\\n\\n\\tMulti-level Lists\\t8\\n\\n\\tContinued Lists\\t8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImages\\n\\nImages can be of three main types. Inline images are images that are part of the normal text flow, like this image of a green dot . Inline images do not cause breaks in the text and are usually small in size. The next category of image is a floating image, one that “floats “ on the page and is surrounded by text. Word supports more types of floating images than are possible with current ebook technology, so the conversion maps floating images to simple left and right floats, as you can see with the left and right arrow images on the sides of this paragraph.\\n\\nThe final type of image is a “block” image, one that becomes a paragraph on its own and has no text on either side. Below is a centered green dot.\\n\\nCentered images like this are useful for large pictures that should be a focus of attention. \\n\\nGenerally, it is not possible to translate the exact positioning of images from a Word document to an ebook. That is because in Word, image positioning is specified in absolute units from the page boundaries.  There is no analogous technology in ebooks, so the conversion will usually end up placing the image either centered or floating close to the point in the text where it was inserted, not necessarily where it appears on the page in Word.\\n\\nLists\\n\\nAll types of lists are supported by the conversion, with the exception of lists that use fancy bullets, these get converted to regular bullets.\\n\\nBulleted List\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nNumbered List\\n\\nOne, with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nMulti-level Lists\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nThree\\n\\nFour with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly.\\n\\nFive\\n\\nSix\\n\\nA Multi-level list with bullets:\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nThis bullet uses an image as the bullet item\\n\\nFour\\n\\nFive\\n\\nContinued Lists\\n\\nOne\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nAn interruption in our regularly scheduled listing, for this essential and very relevant public service announcement.\\n\\nWe now resume our normal programming\\n\\nFour')]"

For other uses, see Spear of Destiny (disambiguation).\\nFresco by Fra Angelico, Dominican monastery at San Marco, Florence, showing the lance piercing the side of Jesus on the cross (c.\\u20091440)\\nThe Holy Lance, also known as the Spear of Longinus (named after Saint Longinus), the Spear of Destiny, or the Holy Spear, is alleged to be the lance that pierced the side of Jesus as he hung on the cross during his crucifixion. As with other instruments of the Passion, the lance is only briefly mentioned in the Christian Bible, but later became the subject of extrabiblical traditions (Apocrypha) in the medieval church. Relics purported to be the lance began to appear as early as the 6th century, originally in Jerusalem. By the Late Middle Ages, relics identified as the spearhead of the Holy Lance (or fragments thereof) had been described throughout Europe. Several of these artifacts are still preserved to this day.\\nHoly Lance relics have typically been used for religious ceremonies, but at times some of them have been considered to be guarantees of victory in battle. For example, Henry the Fowler\\'s lance was credited for winning the Battle of Riade, and the Crusaders believed their discovery of a Holy Lance brought them a favorable end to the Siege of Antioch.\\nIn the modern era, at least four major relics are claimed to be the Holy Lance or parts of it. They are located in Rome, Vienna, Vagharshapat and Antioch. The most prominent Holy Lance relic has been the one in Vienna, adorned with a distinctive gold cuff. This version of the lance is on public display with the rest of the Imperial Regalia at the Hofburg.\\n\\nMiniature of the Crucifixion from the Rabula Gospels. \"Loginos\" is depicted piercing the right side of Jesus with a spear.\\n\\nBiblical references[edit]\\nMain article: Longinus\\nThe lance (Greek: λόγχη, lonkhē) is mentioned in the Gospel of John,[1] but not in the Synoptic Gospels. The gospel states that the Romans planned to break Jesus\\' legs, a practice known as crurifragium, which was a method of hastening death during a crucifixion. Because it was the eve of the Sabbath (Friday sundown to Saturday sundown), the followers of Jesus needed to \"entomb\" him because of Sabbath laws. Just before they did so, they noticed that Jesus was already dead and that there was no reason to break his legs (\"and no bone will be broken\").[2][a] To make sure that he was dead, a Roman soldier (named in extra-Biblical tradition as Longinus) stabbed him in the side.\\n\\nOne of the soldiers pierced his side with a lance (λόγχη), and immediately there came out blood and water.—\\u200aJohn 19:34\\nThe name of the soldier who pierced Christ\\'s side with a lonchē is not given in the Gospel of John, but in the oldest known references to the legend, the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus appended to late manuscripts of the 4th century Acts of Pilate, the soldier is identified as a centurion and called Longinus (making the spear\\'s Latin name Lancea Longini).[3]:\\u200a6–8\\u200a[4]:\\u200a73\\u200a\\nA form of the name Longinus occurs in the Rabula Gospels in the late 6th-century. In a miniature, the name ΛΟΓΙΝΟΣ (LOGINOS) is written above the head of the soldier who is thrusting his lance into Christ\\'s side. This is one of the earliest records of the name, if the inscription is not a later addition.[5]\\n\\nRelics[edit]\\nRome[edit]\\nStatue of Saint Longinus by Gianlorenzo Bernini (1638)\\nA Holy Lance relic is preserved at Saint Peter\\'s Basilica in Vatican City, in a loggia carved into the pillar above the statue of Saint Longinus.[6][7]\\nThe earliest known references to Holy Lance relics date to the 6th century. The Breviary of Jerusalem (circa 530) describes the lance on display at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.[8]:\\u200a14\\u200a[3]:\\u200a57\\u200a In his Expositio Psalmorum (ca. 540-548),[9]:\\u200axv,\\u200a131–136\\u200a Cassiodorus asserts the continued presence of the lance in Jerusalem.[10] A report by the Piacenza pilgrim (ca. 570) places the lance in the Church of Zion.[11]:\\u200a18\\u200a[12] Gregory of Tours described the lance and other relics of the Passion in his Libri Miraculorum (ca. 574-594).[13][14]:\\u200a24\\u200a\\nThe holy lance is also supposed to have been stolen from Rome by Alaric and his Visigoths during their plundering in August 410. Therefore it could have been buried together with Alaric among tons of gold, silver and the golden menorah in Cosenza, southern Italy in the fall of 410. Nobody has found Alaric’s tomb and treasure that was probably emptied by the Byzantines, and therefore the holy lance could possibly appear some hundred years later in Jerusalem.\\nIn 614, Jerusalem was captured by the Sasanian general Shahrbaraz.[15]:\\u200a156\\u200a  The Chronicon Paschale says that the Holy Lance was among the relics captured, but one of Shahrbaraz\\'s associates gave it to Nicetas who brought it to the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople later that year.[15]:\\u200a157\\u200a[16]:\\u200a56\\u200a  However, De locis sanctis, describing the pilgrimage of Arculf in 670,  places the lance in Jerusalem, at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.[17]:\\u200a12\\u200a  Arculf is the last of the medieval pilgrims to report the lance in Jerusalem, as Willibald and Bernard made no mention of it.[18]:\\u200a39\\u200a\\nBy the middle of the 10th century, a lance relic was venerated in Constantinople at the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos.[19]:\\u200acols. 421–423\\u200a[16]:\\u200a58\\u200a[20]:\\u200a35\\u200a The relic was likely viewed by some of the soldiers and clergy participating in the First Crusade, adding to the confusion surrounding the emergence of another Holy Lance at Antioch in 1098.[21]:\\u200a200\\u200a  During the Siege of Tripoli, Raymond of Toulose reportedly brought the Antioch lance to Constantinople, and presented it to Emperor Alexios I Komnenos.[22]:\\u200a185\\u200a[16]:\\u200a59–60\\u200a  Scholars disagree on how this presumably awkward situation was resolved. Steven Runciman argued that the Byzantine court regarded the Antioch relic as a nail (ἧλος), relying on Raymond\\'s ignorance of the Greek language to avoid offending him.[21]:\\u200a202\\u200a  Alternatively, Edgar Robert Ashton Sewter believed that Alexios intended to denounce the crusaders\\' lance as a fraud,[23]:\\u200a526\\u200a and that this was accomplished when Prince Bohemond I of Antioch was compelled in 1108[16]:\\u200a58\\u200a to swear an oath to him on the other lance.[23]:\\u200a397\\u200a Whether Alexios kept the Antioch lance or returned it to Raymond is uncertain.[21]:\\u200a205–206\\u200a Several 12th century documents state that a single Holy Lance was among the relics at Constantinople, without any details that could identify it as either the crusaders\\' discovery or the Byzantine spear.[24][25][26][27]:\\u200a381\\u200a[28]:\\u200a97–98\\u200a\\nAccording to Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, a fragment of the Holy Lance was set into the icon that Alexios V Doukas lost in battle with Henry of Flanders in 1204.[29]:\\u200a302–303\\u200a The capture of this icon by Henry\\'s forces was considered important to many contemporary sources on the Fourth Crusade.[30]:\\u200a90,\\u200an.89\\u200a  In addition to the crusaders\\' report to Pope Innocent III,[31]:\\u200a103\\u200a the incident was documented by Geoffrey of Villehardouin,[32]:\\u200a85–86\\u200a the Devastatio Constantinopolitana,[33]:\\u200a220\\u200a Niketas Choniates,[34]:\\u200a312\\u200a Robert de Clari,[30]:\\u200a88–91\\u200a Ralph of Coggeshall,[35]:\\u200a285\\u200a and Robert of Auxerre.[36]:\\u200a270\\u200a However, none of these sources mention the icon bearing any relics, whereas Alberic claimed it was adorned with the lance fragment, a portion of the Holy Shroud, one of Jesus\\'s deciduous teeth, and other relics from thirty martyrs.[29]:\\u200a302\\u200a  Modern historians have regarded  Alberic\\'s account with some skepticism, characterizing it as \"fanciful\"[37]:\\u200a122,\\u200an.3\\u200a and \"pure invention.\"[38]:\\u200a278–279,\\u200an.128\\u200a  In any case, after the battle the crusaders sent the icon to Cîteaux Abbey,[31]:\\u200a103\\u200a[30]:\\u200a90\\u200a but there is no record of whether it reached that destination.[31]:\\u200a103,\\u200an.375\\u200a\\n\\n16th century Illustration of holy relics displayed in the Grande Châsse the Sainte-Chapelle. The cross on the far right is the reliquary for the Holy Lance relic.\\nFollowing the sack of Constantinople, Robert de Clari described the spoils won by the newly-established Latin Empire, including \"the iron of the lance with which Our Lord had His side pierced,\" in the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos.[30]:\\u200a103\\u200a However by the 1230s, the Latin Empire\\'s financial state had grown desperate.[39]:\\u200a307\\u200a[40]:\\u200a134\\u200a  In 1239, Baldwin II arranged to sell Constantinople\\'s Crown of Thorns relic to  King Louis IX of France.[39]:\\u200a307–308\\u200a  Over the next several years, Baldwin sold a total of twenty-two relics to Louis.[16]:\\u200a62\\u200a[40]  The Holy Lance was included in the final lot, which probably arrived at Paris in 1242.[39]:\\u200a307\\u200a[41]:\\u200a108\\u200a All of these relics were later enshrined in the Sainte Chapelle. During the French Revolution they were removed to the Bibliothèque Nationale, but the lance subsequently disappeared.[5]\\nDespite the transfer of the Holy Lance to Paris, various travelers continued to report its presence in Constantinople throughout the late Byzantine period.[42]:\\u200a88\\u200a[43]:\\u200a10–11\\u200a[44]:\\u200a132\\u200a[45]:\\u200a160\\u200a[46]:\\u200a43\\u200a[47]:\\u200a86\\u200a[48]:\\u200acol. 701\\u200a[49]:\\u200a11\\u200a[50]:\\u200a140\\u200a[51]:\\u200a222\\u200a  Of particular interest, John Mandeville described the lance relics in both Paris and Constantinople, stating that the latter was much larger than the former.[43]:\\u200a10–11\\u200a  Although the authenticity of Mandeville\\'s travelogue is questionable,[52] the widespread popularity of the work demonstrates that the existence of multiple Holy Lance relics was public knowledge.[53]:\\u200a75\\u200a\\n\\nTomb of Pope Innocent VIII, transferred from the Old St. Peter\\'s Basilica. The left hand holds the tip of the holy lance, presented to the Pope by Sultan Bayezid II[54].\\nThe relics remaining in Constantinople, including the lance, were presumably seized by Sultan Mehmed II in 1453 when he conquered the city. In 1492, his son Bayezid II sent the lance to Pope Innocent VIII, to encourage the pope to continue to keep his brother and rival Cem prisoner.[55]:\\u200a311–318\\u200a[5] At this time great doubts as to its authenticity were felt at Rome, as Johann Burchard records,[56] because of the presence of other rival lances in Paris, Nuremberg (see Holy Lance in Vienna below), and Armenia (see Holy Lance in Echmiadzin below).[5] This relic has never since left Rome, and its resting place is at Saint Peter\\'s.[5]  Innocent\\'s tomb, created by Antonio del Pollaiuolo, features a bronze effigy of the pope holding the spear blade he received from Bayezid.[55]:\\u200a321\\u200a\\nIn the mid-18th century Pope Benedict XIV states that he obtained an exact drawing of the Saint Chapelle lance, to compare it with the spearhead in St. Peter\\'s.  He concluded that former relic was the broken point missing from the latter, and that the two fragments had originally formed one blade.[57]:\\u200a323\\u200a\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA mitred Adhémar de Monteil carrying one of the instances of the Holy Lance in one of the battles of the First Crusade\\n\\n\\n\\n1898 drawing of the Holy Lance in Rome\\n\\n\\nVienna[edit]\\nThe Holy Lance (left) on display with other items from the Imperial Regalia in Vienna\\nThe Holy Lance in Vienna is displayed in the Imperial Treasury or Weltliche Schatzkammer (lit. Worldly Treasure Room) at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Austria.[58] It is the head of a typical winged lance of the Carolingian dynasty.[58] The shaft was presumably lost or destroyed by the reign of Conrad II (1024–1039), who commissioned the Reichskreuz (\"Imperial Cross\") to serve as a reliquary for the spearhead.[59]:\\u200a36\\u200a\\nThe spearhead is wrapped in a distinctive gold cuff, added by Charles IV around 1354. The cuff is inscribed with the Latin text \"LANCEA ET CLAVVS DOMINI\" (\"The lance and nail of the Lord\"), affirming that the lance was once used by Longinus and that one of the Holy Nails has been incorporated into the spearhead.[53]:\\u200a76\\u200a[60]:\\u200a181\\u200a  The gold cuff covers an older, silver cuff produced for Henry IV between 1084 and 1105, which also refers to the Holy Nail but identifies the spearhead as the lance of Saint Maurice.  Gilded stripes on both sides of the silver cuff bear another Latin inscription: \"CLAVVS DOMINICVS HEINRICVS D[EI] GR[ATI]A TERCIVS / ROMANO[RVM] IMPERATOR AVG[VSTVS] HOC ARGEN / TVM IVSSIT / FABRICARl AD CONFIRMATIONE[M] / CLAVI D[OMI]NI ET LANCEE SANCTI MAVRI / CII // SANCTVS MAVRICIVS\" (\"Nail of the Lord Henry by the Grace of God the Third, Emperor of the Romans and Augustus, ordered this silver piece to be made to reinforce the Nail of the Lord and the Lance of St. Maurice / Saint Maurice\").[59]:\\u200a23–24\\u200a[60]:\\u200a181\\u200a  The inscription refers to Henry IV, the fourth of his name to reign as King of Germany, as \"the third\" because he was the third of his name crowned Holy Roman Emperor.[59]:\\u200a24\\u200a\\nAccording to Liutprand of Cremona, the first German monarch to obtain the lance was King Henry the Fowler who purchased it in  926,[59]:\\u200a27\\u200a from King Rudolf II of Burgundy.[61]:\\u200a160\\u200a[60]:\\u200a178\\u200a  Rudolf is supposed to have received the lance as a gift from a \"Count Samson,\",[61]:\\u200a160\\u200a about whom nothing else is known.[59]:\\u200a47 n.70\\u200a  Liutprand associated the lance not with Longinus, but with Constantine the Great, citing a claim that the Roman emperor used the Holy Nails, discovered by his mother Helena, to make crosses in the middle of the spearhead.[61]:\\u200a160\\u200a[60]:\\u200a178\\u200a  The description given by Liutprand closely corresponds to the relic kept in Vienna today.[59]:\\u200a29\\u200a\\nAn alternative account of how Henry received the lance is offered by Widukind of Corvey.  According to Widukind, King Conrad I of Germany made arrangements on his deathbed in 918 to send his royal insignia, including the Holy Lance, to Henry, who would succeed him as king of East Francia.[62]  This version of events has been rejected by historians.[60]:\\u200a181\\u200a\\nOn 15 March 933, Henry carried his lance as he led his forces against the Magyars in the Battle of Riade.  From that point forward, the Ottonian dynasty regarded the lance as a talisman guaranteeing victory.[59]:\\u200a27\\u200a  The timing of the battle—on the feast day of Longinus—indicates that by this time Henry associated the relic with the lance used in the crucifixion.[59]:\\u200a27,\\u200a46 n.81\\u200a  Along the same lines, it may be telling that Henry\\'s son Otto the Great fought the Battle of Birten in the first half of March 939.[59]:\\u200a27–28\\u200a  However, in 955 Otto sought support from Saint Lawrence to secure victory in the Battle of Lechfeld, which was planned to occur on Lawrence\\'s feast day.[59]:\\u200a28\\u200a  This shift may have resulted from the increased diplomatic ties between Germany and the Byzantine Empire circa 949/950.  As the Germans became aware of the Byzantine version of the Holy Lance, it became politically inconvenient to associate the Ottonian lance with Longinus.[59]:\\u200a28\\u200a  By 1008 the lance was identified with that of Saint Maurice,[59]:\\u200a36–38\\u200a who had been venerated by Otto the Great.[59]:\\u200a41–42\\u200a\\nOtto III commissioned two replicas of the lance.  One of these was given to Prince Vajk of Hungary in 996, who was later crowned King Stephen I.[59]:\\u200a30\\u200a  The other was presented to Duke of Poland, Bolesław I, at the Congress of Gniezno in 1000.[63]:\\u200a351\\u200a[64] The Polish lance is currently displayed in the John Paul II Cathedral Museum in Kraków.[65]  The fate of the Hungarian lance is less clear.  When Stephen\\'s successor, Peter Orseolo was deposed in 1041, he sought the aid of German king Henry III, who captured the lance in the Battle of Ménfő.  Whether Henry returned the lance to Peter upon his restoration is uncertain.[59]:\\u200a34\\u200a  Shortly before World War I, a gold-inlaid spearhead, identified as a Germanic work from around the year 1000, was dredged from the Danube River near Budapest.[66]:\\u200a7\\u200a[67]:\\u200a519\\u200a  The gold inlay suggests that this artifact could be Stephen\\'s lance replica, but this has not been confirmed.[59]:\\u200a34\\u200a\\nIn 1424, Sigismund had a collection of relics, including the lance, moved from his capital in Prague to his birthplace, Nuremberg, and decreed them to be kept there forever.[68]:\\u200a7–8\\u200a This collection was called the Imperial Regalia (Reichskleinodien).[68]\\nWhen the French Revolutionary army approached Nuremberg in the spring of 1796, the local authorities turned over the Imperial Regalia to Johann Alois von Hügel, Chief Commissary of the Imperial Diet.[69]:\\u200a18–19\\u200a[70]:\\u200a732\\u200a  Baron von Hügel took the regalia to Ratisbon for safekeeping, but by 1800 that city was also under threat of invasion, so he relocated them again to Passau, Linz, and Vienna.[69]  When the French entered Vienna in 1805, the collection was moved again to Hungary, before ultimately returning to Vienna.[70]:\\u200a732\\u200a[69]:\\u200a19\\u200a  These movements were conducted in secret, as the status of the regalia had not been resolved amid plans for the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.  When Nuremberg later appealed for the return of the regalia, the city\\'s requests were easily dismissed by the Austrian Empire.[70]:\\u200a732\\u200a\\nThe Kunsthistorisches Museum has dated the lance to the 8th century.[58] Robert Feather, an English metallurgist and technical engineering writer, tested it for a documentary in January 2003.[71][72] Based on X-ray diffraction, fluorescence tests, and other noninvasive procedures, he dated the main body of the spear to the 7th century at the earliest.[72] Feather stated in the same documentary that an iron pin – long claimed to be a nail from the crucifixion, hammered into the blade and set off by tiny brass crosses – was \"consistent\" in length and shape with a 1st-century AD Roman nail.[72]\\nNot long afterward, researchers at the Interdisciplinary Research Institute for Archeology in Vienna used X-ray and other technology to examine a range of lances, and determined that the Vienna lance dates from around the 8th to the beginning of the 9th century, with the nail apparently being of the same metal, and ruled out the possibility of it dating back to the 1st century AD.[73]\\nThe Hofburg spear has been re-imagined in popular culture as a magical talisman whose powers may be used for good or evil.[74]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHoly Lance displayed in the Imperial Treasury at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Austria\\n\\n\\n\\nPolish replica of the Holy Lance, Wawel Hill, Kraków\\n\\n\\n\\nThe inscription on the Holy Lance\\n\\n\\nVagharshapat[edit]\\nThe Holy Lance in Vagharshapat\\nA Holy Lance is conserved in Vagharshapat (previously known as Echmiadzin), the religious capital of Armenia. It was previously held in the monastery of Geghard.The first source that mentions it is a text Holy Relics of Our Lord Jesus Christ, in a thirteenth-century Armenian manuscript.  According to this text, the spear which pierced Jesus was to have been brought to Armenia by the Apostle Thaddeus. The manuscript does not specify precisely where it was kept, but the Holy Relics gives a description that exactly matches the lance, the monastery gate (since the thirteenth century precisely), and the name of Geghardavank (Monastery of the Holy Lance).[75]:\\u200a254–256\\u200a\\nIn 1655, the French traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier was the first Westerner to see this relic in Armenia. In 1805, the Russians captured the monastery and the relic was moved to Tchitchanov Geghard, Tbilisi, Georgia.[76]\\nIt was later returned to Armenia, and is still on display at the Manoogian museum in Vagharshapat, enshrined in a 17th-century reliquary. Every year during the commemoration of the apostles St. Thaddeus and St. Bartholomew the relic is brought out for worship.[77]\\n\\nAntioch[edit]\\nThe Discovery of the Holy Lance in Antioch\\nDuring the June 1098 Siege of Antioch, a monk named Peter Bartholomew reported that he had a vision in which St. Andrew told him that the Holy Lance was buried in the Church of St. Peter in Antioch.[78]:\\u200a241–243\\u200a After much digging in the cathedral, Bartholomew allegedly discovered a lance.[78]:\\u200a243–245\\u200a Despite the doubts of many, including the papal legate Adhemar of Le Puy, many of the crusaders credited the discovery of the lance for their subsequent victory in the Battle of Antioch, which broke the siege and secured the city.[78]:\\u200a247–249,\\u200a253–254\\u200a[20]:\\u200a34–35\\u200a\\nGreek Orthodox sources such as the biography of patriarch Christopher indicate that a relic thought to be the Holy Lance was among the treasures of the church of St. Peter as early as the 10th century.[79] Historian Klaus-Peter Todt has suggested this relic could have been buried to hide it from Seljuk forces in 1084, allowing the crusaders to find it in 1098.[80]:\\u200a99\\u200a\\n\\nLiterary[edit]\\nThe Holy Lance in Parsifal, Act 3 (by Arnaldo dell\\'Ira, c.\\u20091930)\\nThe Holy Lance has been conflated with the bleeding lance depicted in the unfinished 12th century romance Perceval, the Story of the Grail by Chrétien de Troyes.[81]:\\u200a1–2\\u200a  The story also refers to a javelot that has wounded the Fisher King,  which may or may not be intended to be one and the same with the bleeding lance.[81]:\\u200a3\\u200a[82] Chrétien ascribes supernaturally destructive powers to the bleeding spear, which are inconsistent with any Christian tradition.[81]:\\u200a2,\\u200a6–7,\\u200a11–13,\\u200a17\\u200a  Nevertheless, the continuations of Chrétien\\'s poem attempted to explain the mysteries of the bleeding spear by identifying it with the lance from John 19:34.[81]:\\u200a14–15\\u200a[3]:\\u200a166\\u200a[83]:\\u200a79\\u200a\\nChrétien\\'s Perceval was adapted by Wolfram von Eschenbach into the German epic Parzival.[84][85]  Like Chrétien, Wolfram depicts the bleeding lance in a manner that cannot easily be reconciled with the spear of Longinus.[81]:\\u200a5\\u200a Parzival became the primary source for Richard Wagner\\'s 1882 opera Parsifal, in which the Fisher King is wounded by the spear that pierced Jesus\\'s side.[86]:\\u200a1,\\u200a16–20\\u200a\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nHoly Chalice\\xa0– Vessel that Jesus used at the Last Supper to serve wine\\nHoly Sponge\\xa0– Instrument of the Passion of Jesus Christ\\nImage of Edessa\\xa0– A painting of Jesus Christ\\'s face\\nSeamless robe of Jesus\\xa0– Robe said to have been worn by Jesus during or shortly before his crucifixion\\nTrue Cross\\xa0– Cross upon which Jesus was crucified\\nExplanatory notes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ This verse is reference to Psalms 34:20 regarding the righteous person, and commandments concerning the paschal lamb in Exodus 12:46 and Numbers 9:12.\\n\\n\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ John 19:31–37\\n\\n^ John 19:36\\n\\n^ a b c Peebles, Rose Jeffries (1911).
